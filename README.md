# Guardian the last bulwark against cheaters !!!

## So what is [Guardian](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/guardian.48836/) ?
While lots of anti-cheats plugins try to detect if a player is cheating or not, Guardian takes a completely different approach.
Why trying to detect cheaters if you can block them before they enter your server?
